## How To Use

You need basic knowledge of command line tools to run the code yourself. The commands shown below need to be typed into a shell inside a terminal to work.

1. Install [`Git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

   Pull down the source code from GitHub.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/robertying/nurtue-app.git
   cd nurtue-app
   ```

2. Install required software to setup the development environment.

   You need to at least install [`Node.js LTS`](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [`Yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

3. Install Expo CLI and Expo Go app.

   [Follow Expo's instructions.](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

4. Install project dependencies.

   ```shell
   yarn install
   ```

5. Start the dev server.

   ```shell
   yarn start
   ```

6. Follow the on-screen instructions from Expo CLI.

   For example, press `i` in the terminal to open the app inside an iOS simulator; or scan the QR code to open the app on your phone with Expo Go.

7. Wait for the app to finish loading.

   Then you are good to go! Enjoy Nurtue!
