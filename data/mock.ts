          "This is one of those parenting questions for new parents that are often perplexing because there is no precise answer. All babies have unique sleep patterns and reasons why they sleep how they do or why they have troubles. In fact, some babies even need a full year to develop a proper sleep cycle at night. To help them associate bed with sleep, put them in the crib when they are sleepy and not fully asleep. This helps build an association that is covered with a blanket means sleep time. You can begin their sleep training by the time they are 6 months old.",

          "The term dating has evolved quite a bit from what it used to be due to technology that allows instant contact through messengers and video calls. Sometimes even kids as young as fifth grade believe they're dating someone when all they're really doing is text a lot. It's hard to assign an age as the right start for dating as different kids mature emotionally at different ages, and it is up to you to explain to them the differences between close friendships and romance. With an open dialogue, you can both arrive organically when your kid is ready to go out with someone.",
